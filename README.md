# stepper_tester
This was a quick one-off stepper tester board using an Allegro chip for the motor control, and a 2 way sliding joystick for speed control. 

Note: A more up to date version of this project can be found on my website. 
## Operating Instructions
* Move the joystick up and down to change the pulse frequency within a single micro-stepping band (zero centered).
* Flick the joystick side to side to change the microstepping level.
